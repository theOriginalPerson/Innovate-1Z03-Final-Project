            <p class="introParagraph">
                With the past behind us, we have seen notable individuals create some of the most important technology known to man. 
                From the invention of the computer by Charles Babbage, to the electronic transistor, we have made leaps and bounds in progress. 
                However, there is still so much to be learned and so much more to be created. There are numerous problems we have in society that haunt 
                scientists and engineers alike day and night. Many of these noble men and women are having a difficult time trying to solve seemingly 
                obvious problems. And as we know, it is not solving the problem that is the most difficult, but rather defining it.<br><br>
                During the early Artificial Intelligence (AI) years, researchers mostly attempted at solving how to get a computer to do complex problems 
                via logical sequences. You see, a computer is not exactly bright - it is rather brainless (quite literally). You must command the computer 
                into doing a certain thing that only the human was able to tell it to do. Without us, computers are nothing. And without computers, we are 
                much weaker. Again, the issue is mostly at defining the problem correctly.<br><br>
                This, of course, is life before AI. Once we perfect it, we will be able to do amazing things, like solving many complex problems we 
                could not do without it. One major problem we are still striving to solve on our own is the idea of autonomous vehicles. Will we be 
                able to actually bring life to a car? We have already seen autonomous cars, like Teslas, in action on the highway. However, there are 
                still many issues that come along with them.

        <div class="currentDiv">
            <h1 id="current" class="currentP">CURRENT PROBLEM</h1>
            <p class="currentProblemParagraph">
                There are many problems with autonomous vehicles currently. More often than not, it is a software related problem, and other times 
                it might be a hardware issue. But these are not the problems that I am interested in. These issues, when combined with formal machine 
                learning algorithms, are easily solvable. The main problem with autonomous vehicles is that they must communicate with one another on 
                a network. The reason this is a problem is precisely because there are too many cars that cannot communicate with these autonomous 
                vehicles, such as older models, which is cause for concern.<br><br>
                The communication between modern autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles is called <q>vehicle-to-vehicle communication</q>, or V2V for short. 
                The company that had started this project was General Motors (GM), back in 2007 (acarplace, n.d.). They proposed a communication system 
                between vehicles, networks and infrastructure to allow for a more connected and safer traffic system. Despite their demonstration in 
                2007, GM had not made much progress with the technology. In 2015, Toyota became the first automotive company to deploy V2X 
                (vehicle-to-everything) communication (Hall-Geisler, 2016). They tested it out on 3 models of cars in Japan, and they are still 
                trying to find proper data from this as not every car has the technology.<br><br>
                To sum up the current problem, it would be the fact that older models of vehicles are not properly equipped to drive safely in a 
                world full of talking cars. This will be a world where many individuals will solely rely on the car to tell them when to watch out 
                for problems, opposed to paying attention to the road for themselves. I call this form of driver neglect, <q>autonomous vehicle naivety</q>, 
                or AVN for short.

        <div class="proposeDiv">
            <h1 id="proposed" class="proposedS">PROPOSED SOLUTION</h1>
            <p class="proposeParagraph">
                There are two possible solutions to this problem. The first potential solution is more of a long term solution, and it is still 
                quite practical as that is where we are currently headed. This would be where everyone becomes an owner of a modern car with V2V 
                communication, whether autonomous or not. However, given that not everyone can afford this type of car, this solution is yet to be 
                seen in our society for another 10 to 20 years. This means that we will most likely be looking to implement a system that works for 
                every car during the 10-20 year waiting period.<br><br>
                The solution I am proposing is a universal, AI-controlled V2X device that connects with multiple components within an older vehicle 
                that does not originally support V2V. There are currently few, if any, attempts at solving this problem, making my proposal nearly 
                novel. It is not as if this issue has not been addressed in multiple articles. It is simply a lack of time and technological investment 
                from the perspective of major automotive companies. Furthermore, most of the current technology being explored for this issue will only 
                be able to send a signal to other cars, without warning the driver of the older vehicle (Huetter, 2016). The problem with this is 
                that it only makes the road somewhat safer. What if the road is mostly filled with older vehicles who do not have any warnings coming 
                their way? This can create unnecessary havoc to a very simple problem that can be solved immediately.<br><br>
                The device that my hypothetical AI company would create would be a special sensor that wirelessly connects and exchanges information 
                with a GPS a user can buy from the store, or from us. The sensor would be connected between the dashboard cables (which deliver 
                information to the dashboard, like speed, etc) and dashboard (which reads the information to the driver). Furthermore, the sensor 
                would act like a passive transmitter of information, where electronic information gets passed through it allowing it to work 
                uninterrupted on the dashboard. We would also create a USB network driver which would connect to the GPS manually, allowing it to 
                connect with other vehicles and infrastructure. The passive information from the sensor would then be wirelessly transmitted to the 
                GPS, letting other drivers on the road know of this vehicular information. Moreover, the driver would receive signals from other cars 
                on the same network (which would likely be most cars, if the government takes action to make this a mandatory device in each vehicle), 
                and would showcase this through the GPS with several different kinds of warnings / sounds.<br><br>
                As mentioned previously, the main issue with this problem is the lack of definition it has from major companies trying to solve it. 
                In this proposition, I will attempt to define this issue for them. Firstly, the major automotive companies are not entirely sure 
                whether to pursue this issue considering how little money it would generate for them. However, for third-party companies, this could 
                be a golden opportunity given such a short-term. In the worst case scenario, they will last 10-20 years, and die a rich company 
                (obviously aware that they cannot last much longer than 20 years). Secondly, how would you implement this technology in older vehicles? 
                It would certainly be a challenge considering many of their parts are not as advanced. The dashboard cables function differently, and 
                many of them do not have electronic dashboards - but rather mechanical ones. However, given the overall engineering finesse that larger 
                companies have, it should not be impossible. Thirdly, in order to fully understand the length and breadth of this potential technology, 
                we would need to test it out on some vehicles that constantly travel (potentially older models of taxis and semi-trucks) in order to 
                get accurate information about where to improve. Overall, the problem is not unsolvable, it is simply too much effort with too little 
                reward for larger companies to pursue.<br><br>
                The proposed device would be implemented fairly and would be sought after by the government. In the United States, the National 
                Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is attempting to implement mandatory rules for new cars around 2023 (Huetter, 2016), 
                forcing them to have V2V communication devices. Given the fact that many nations would love to have this technology in their homelands, 
                governments around the world must begin writing new laws surrounding the use of it. With that being said, this will be a fair and 
                regulated type of technology that is equally distributed amongst drivers. There will also most likely be penalties for any drivers 
                that do not have this technology connected to their cars.<br><br>
                Naturally, the AI technologies being involved would be a software system that connects to other networks of drivers. The software 
                would be created with the intention of it being deployed through a GPS monitor. The GPS would act like a relay between the driver 
                and the network, sending information from the driver’s car to the network of other drivers, and send incoming information to the GPS 
                from the network of other drivers to the said driver. The sensor that was previously mentioned will be used to connect the electronic 
                information from the dashboard cables recording the speed (and other measurements) to the GPS. This is how the separate GPS will know 
                of the information being transmitted.<br><br>
                GM had been working on a way to create something that would solve this issue, however they have not been able to implement much of 
                the V2V communication to new vehicles, let alone older models. With all the hype of the technology behind them, it is evident that 
                they were not successful considering Toyota had first deployed them in Japan (Hall-Geisler, 2016), as previously mentioned. Our 
                technology would be similar to the technology already available, but simply for older vehicles.<br><br>
